EconoRoute Cost Effective and Fast Query Routing Innovation. This research addresses the challenge of de- veloping a cost and compute effective system for routing GenAl based complex queries. The aim is to cre ate a routing approach that is both faster and as accurate as current LLM-based routing methods. The re- search will explore whether a simpler, hybrid system can effectively perform query routing and will investi- gate the underlying reasons for its performance Idea is to develop a hybrid system which initially uses LLM for routing and leams from it and later on does not utilize the LLM for routing [1] GitHub Link: bues//github.com/anyscale/Ilm-router
