EconoRoute Cost Effective and Fast Query Routing Innovation. This research addresses the challenge of developing a cost and compute effective system for routing GenAl based complex queries. 
The aim is to create a routing approach that is both faster and as accurate as current LLM-based routing methods. The research will explore whether a simpler, hybrid system can effectively perform query routing and will investigate the underlying reasons for its performance Idea is to develop a hybrid system which initially uses LLM for routing and leams from it and later on does not utilize the LLM for routing
